Nucleotide Variation: A sliding window computation to compare nucleotide variation metrics between two Drosophila melanogaster populations was designed with R. Efficiency and reduced memory usage were important parameters in the design method. 

GWAS: This GWAS examines case-control SNPs associated with colon cancer in 2312 individuals. The dataset was tested for population stratification and multiplicity corrections applied. 

Tidy: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset (www.smartlab.ws) [1] is cleaned to produce a tidy data set of 180 observations of 81 variables.
